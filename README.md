A go package for reading and writing messages in the maildir format.

> The Maildir e-mail format is a common way of storing e-mail messages, where each message is kept in a separate file with a unique name, and each folder is a directory. The local filesystem handles file locking as messages are added, moved and deleted. A major design goal of Maildir is to eliminate program code having to handle locking, which is often difficult.

Refer http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir

## Installation

You can download the package using

``` go
go get github.com/amalfra/maildir
```

## Usage

Next, import the package

``` go
import (
  "github.com/amalfra/maildir"
)
```

#### Create a maildir in /home/amal/mail
``` go
myMaildir := maildir.NewMaildir("/home/amal/mail")
```

This command automatically creates the standard Maildir directories - `cur`,
`new`, and `tmp` - if they do not exist.

#### Add a new message
This creates a new file with the contents "foo"; returns the Message struct reference. Messages are written to the tmp dir then moved to new.
``` go
message, err := myMaildir.Add("foo")
```

#### List new messages
``` go
mailList, err := myMaildir.List("new")
```
This will return a map of messages by key, sorted by key

#### List current messages
``` go
mailList, err := myMaildir.List("cur")
```
This will return a map of messages by key, sorted by key

#### Find the message using key
``` go
message := maildir.Get(key)
```

#### Delete the message from disk by key
``` go
err := maildir.Delete(key)
```

**Below are the methods that are available on Message instance**

#### Get the key used to uniquely identify the message
``` go
key := message.Key()
```

#### Load the message content from file
``` go
data, err := message.GetData()
```

#### Process message - move the message from "new" to "cur"
This is usaully done to indicate that some process has retrieved the message.
``` go
key, err := message.Process("new")
```
